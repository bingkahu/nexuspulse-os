# ⚡ NexusPulse OS
**The Repository Vitality Monitor** [Live App: nexuspulse-os.pages.dev](https://nexuspulse-os.pages.dev)

NexusPulse is a high-octane, edge-powered dashboard that turns raw GitHub data into a living "Vitality Score." Designed for the modern web, it provides a real-time pulse check on open-source health with zero latency.



## 🔮 What is Vitality?
In the world of code, static stars don't tell the full story. NexusPulse measures **momentum**. Our Vitality Engine analyzes:

* **Pulse (Commit Velocity):** Not just total commits, but the rhythm of activity over the last 30 days.
* **Flow (PR Efficiency):** How fast ideas are turning into merged code.
* **Weight (Issue Health):** Identifying "stale" blockers that are slowing the project down.
* **Community:** Real-time contributor tracking and star-to-fork ratios.

## ⚡ Built for the Edge
NexusPulse doesn't just display data; it lives on the edge.
* **Blazing Fast:** Hosted on [nexuspulse-os.pages.dev](https://nexuspulse-os.pages.dev) via Cloudflare Pages for instant global delivery.
* **Live Sync:** Directly integrated with the GitHub Search API for up-to-the-minute accuracy.
* **Dynamic Mascot:** An interactive UI state machine that reacts to the repository's health status.

## 🛠 Powering the Pulse
This application leverages **Next.js 14** and **Tailwind CSS**, optimized specifically for the Cloudflare V8 runtime. By utilizing a custom-built `ghFetch` layer, we maintain a lightweight footprint without the baggage of heavy HTTP libraries.
